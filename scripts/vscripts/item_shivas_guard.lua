	Called when Shiva's Guard is cast.  Emits a slowly increasing wave emanating from the caster that applies a
	debuff to enemies within its current radius.
	Additional parameters: keys.BlastFinalRadius, keys.BlastSpeedPerSecond, keys.BlastDamage, keys.BlastVisionRadius,
		and keys.BlastVisionDuration
	Known bugs:
		This implementation only supports one blast radiating outwards from the same unit at a time (the debuff 
			will be applied to units within the most recently emitted blast's radius).  This should only be an
			issue when Refresher Orb or Tinker's Rearm are involved.
		Blast damage is only dealt if the affected unit does not already have a blast debuff on them.  The duration
			is also not refreshed if the affected unit already has a blast debuff on them.  Once a function such as
			HasModifierByNameAndCaster() is exposed, this bug can be resolved (for now, it is only an issue when
			multiple players have a Shiva's Guard or when Shiva's Guard's cooldown gets refreshed.
		The particle effect does not seem to have 100% visual parity.
		The vision provided when Shiva's Guard is cast should be flying vision, not ground vision.
